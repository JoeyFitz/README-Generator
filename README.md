To install this application, first ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Clone this repo to the desired location and from an integrated terminal, use node package manager (npm) to install 'inquirer'.

## Usage
Using CLI, submit 'node index.js' to initiate the command line prompts that will lead you through README file creation. Once complete with the prompts, the README.md file will be created within the current project folder.
